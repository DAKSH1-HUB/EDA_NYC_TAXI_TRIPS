# EDA_NYC_TAXI_TRIPS

The aim of this Exploratory Data Analysis was to explore the real world Dataset and generate Insights.</br>

Data set contained 729322 rows and 11 columns. </br>

Variable Info:-</br>

id - a unique identifier for each trip</br>
vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record</br>
pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged</br>
dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged</br>
passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)</br>
pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged</br>
pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged</br>
dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged</br>
dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged</br>
store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server (Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip)</br>
trip_duration - (target) duration of the trip in seconds</br>

# METHODOLOGY
Data Loading -> Variable identification & type casting -> Date time Extraction -> missing value identification -> outlier Detection -> KDE & Boxplot Univariate Analysis -> Bivariate Analysis </br>
# INSIGHTS
